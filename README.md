# Overview of Wireless Sensing

For this project I wrote a [paper](../main/paper.pdf) on the topic of wireless sensing, also called sensorless sensing. In this paper an overview of the relevant literature, history, use cases, and technologies are given. We also pay attention to alternative technologies, as well as future trends and challenges.

# Abstract

Throughout history there has been a lot of research on wireless technology, mainly for communication purposes. Another purpose is the remote sensing of objects and activities, to which we refer as wireless sensing. In the past decade a significant amount of research has been performed concerning wireless sensing, with the technology being applied to many areas such as the detection of human presence, gesture detection, agriculture, law enforcement, and healthcare. In this overview we present a number of wireless sensing solutions and analyse them according to their history, application, wireless technology, and processing technique. Furthermore, wireless sensing is compared to alternative technologies. Finally, we also give an overview of the current challenges and possible future trends.
