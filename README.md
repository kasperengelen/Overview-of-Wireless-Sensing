# Overview of Wireless Sensing

For this project I wrote a paper on the topic of wireless sensing, also called sensorless sensing. In this paper an overview of the relevant literature, history, use cases, and technologies are given. We also pay attention to alternative technologies, as well as future trends and challenges.
